# Foxhole for Claude — Firefox Extension

## Architecture

Firefox WebExtension (Manifest V2) with four layers:

| Layer | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Background | `background/` | Claude API calls, tool routing, site knowledge, prompt injection defense |
| Content script | `content/content.js` | Executes in page context (DOM, screenshots, clicks, cleaned page content) |
| Sidebar | `sidebar/` | Chat UI, toolbar, modals, tab management, streaming renderer |
| Options | `options/` | Settings page (API key, model, high-risk tools) |

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `background/background.js` | Message hub, conversation loop, context compression, auto-continue |
| `background/tools.js` | All tool definitions sent to Claude API |
| `background/tool-router.js` | Tool execution dispatch + handlers (including `save_site_spec`, `delete_site_spec`) |
| `background/site-knowledge.js` | Per-domain spec storage, staleness badges, profile rendering, prompt formatting |
| `background/system-prompt.txt` | Claude's system prompt — assistant philosophy, rules, site knowledge, discovery |
| `background/content-sanitizer.js` | Prompt injection detection — marks suspicious patterns in page content |
| `background/claude-api.js` | API client with retry logic (429/500/502/503/529 with backoff) |
| `background/prompt-loader.js` | Loads and caches system prompt from `.txt` file |
| `background/api-observer.js` | Passive network request observer — records API patterns per domain |
| `background/interaction-observer.js` | Passive DOM interaction observer — records working selectors per domain |
| `sidebar/sidebar.js` | Main sidebar logic, token tracking, event wiring, model migration |
| `sidebar/modules/stream-renderer.js` | Streaming display, message finalization (response text above activity log) |
| `sidebar/modules/activity-log.js` | Collapsible tool call display, HTML conversion button |
| `sidebar/modules/modal-manager.js` | All modals (confirmation, API key, shortcuts) |
| `sidebar/modules/tab-manager.js` | Per-tab conversation/state management |

## Core Design: Assistant, Not Automation

The extension is a browser **assistant** — Claude helps the user interact with pages, it does not run unattended automation. Key implications:

- **Delegate to the user** when one click beats five tool calls (age gates, login, CAPTCHAs, location selectors)
- **Escalate on failure** — don't silently try alternative approaches after a state change fails
- **First-visit discovery** — on new sites, probe DOM for framework + check API observer before guessing

This philosophy is enforced in `system-prompt.txt` rules 5 and 6.

## Element Registry (tref_N handles)

`content.js` maintains a WeakRef-based element registry (module-level `_foxRefMap` / `_foxReverseMap`). Any element registered gets a stable `tref_N` string handle that survives SPA re-renders for the current page session.

- `registerElement(el)` — idempotent; returns existing handle if already registered
- `findElement(selector)` — accepts both CSS selectors and `tref_N` handles; used by every interaction tool
- `get_accessibility_tree` and `find_elements` register and return `tref_N` handles so callers can pass them directly to `click_element`, `type_text`, etc.

## Tool Inventory

Tools live in `background/tools.js` (definitions) and are dispatched in `background/tool-router.js`. Content-script tools are routed via `sendToContentScript`.

**Element interaction:** `click_element`, `type_text`, `hover_element`, `focus_element`, `press_key`, `select_option`, `set_checkbox`, `upload_file` — all accept `tref_N` handles or CSS selectors

**Discovery:** `get_accessibility_tree` (cheapest, use first), `find_elements` (natural language), `execute_script`, `get_page_content`, `dom_stats`, `detect_page_tech`

**Navigation:** `navigate`, `scroll_to`, `wait_for_element`, `go_back`, `go_forward`, `reload_page`

**Data:** `fetch_url` (background, no auth), `fetch_with_session` (in-page, carries auth cookies), `get_network_requests`, `clear_network_requests`

**Page modification:** `inject_css`, `toggle_selection_mode`, `get_user_selections`

**Capture:** `take_screenshot`, `take_region_screenshot`, `get_performance_metrics`, `audit_accessibility`

**Dialogs:** `handle_dialog` — intercepts alert/confirm/prompt before they block; `drain` mode retrieves post-hoc

**Site knowledge:** `save_site_spec`, `delete_site_spec`

## Site Knowledge System

Persistent per-domain specs stored in `browser.storage.local`, injected into Claude's system prompt on every request.

### Spec types

| Type | Purpose | Cardinality |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `profile` | Site interaction model (UI-ONLY / API / HYBRID) | One per domain (auto-updated) |
| `dom` | CSS selectors | Many |
| `api` | Endpoints | Many |
| `storage` | localStorage/cookie keys | Many |
| `shortcut` | Multi-step workflows | Many |

### Staleness

Specs get age badges in prompt formatting (`site-knowledge.js:formatForPrompt`):
- **< 3 weeks** — no badge, use confidently
- **3-8 weeks** — `[aging]`
- **> 2 months** — `[STALE — verify before using]`

Each spec shows its `spec_id` as a `#xxxx` suffix at the end of the spec heading so Claude can delete broken ones with `delete_site_spec`.

### Profile rendering

Profile specs render first, above all other specs, in a box-drawing border with no code fence (raw text for readability).

## Site Manipulation Playbook

`docs/site-manipulation-playbook.md` — engineering techniques for reading and driving modern SPA/GraphQL sites when DOM scraping fails or goes stale: reading React fiber state (`wrappedJSObject` in FF, MAIN world in Chrome), client-side-nav-fires-no-network staleness, response-body capture (`filterResponseData` vs fetch/XHR monkey-patch), persisted-query/CSRF API replay, stall-guarded pagination, and clipboard reliability. Read it before touching `content/content.js`, the observers, or the Chrome port.

## Prompt Injection Defense

Three layers:

1. **Content cleaning** (`content.js:getCleanedPageContent`) — strips hidden elements, scripts, styles, comments, `aria-hidden` nodes before returning HTML to Claude
2. **Pattern detection** (`content-sanitizer.js`) — wraps instruction overrides, role impersonation, fake urgency, fake tool markup, data exfiltration attempts in `[SUSPICIOUS:LABEL]` markers
3. **Page content markers** (`background.js`) — page-reading tool results wrapped in `[PAGE_CONTENT_START]`/`[PAGE_CONTENT_END]` so Claude treats them as data, not instructions

## Context Compression

Three-tier system in `background.js`:

1. **Progressive** (every call) — strips screenshots from turns >2 old, replaces tool results >500 chars in turns >4 old with semantic summaries
2. **Basic** (`compressConversationHistory`) — replaces all large tool results with semantic summaries
3. **Aggressive** (at 60% context threshold) — summarizes old turns into compressed history block, keeps last 4 turns

Tool results are stamped with `[TOOL_SUMMARY] [toolName] description...` at creation time so compression extracts semantic summaries instead of truncating raw data.

## System Prompt Structure

Built in `background.js:buildSystemPrompt()`. Two blocks sent to the API:

1. **Dynamic context** (first, cached per domain) — site knowledge, API observer patterns, DOM interaction patterns, autonomy mode
2. **Static base prompt** (second, cached) — loaded from `system-prompt.txt`

Dynamic context comes first so Claude reads site knowledge before the instructions that reference it.

## Permission Model

Two modes controlled by autonomy dropdown in toolbar:

- **"Confirm risky actions"** (default) — high-risk tools show confirmation modal
- **"Skip all confirmations"** — everything auto-executes

Logic: `needsConfirmation = mode === 'ask' && isHighRisk`

## Message Layout

In `stream-renderer.js:finalizeMessage()`, the DOM order is:

1. Response text (the useful output — front and center)
2. Activity log (collapsible tool calls — below, expandable if curious)

## Versioning & Release — MANDATORY

All work happens on `develop`. Releases go to `master`.

| Step | Command | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1. Commit work on `develop` | `git commit` | develop at 1.8.0 |
| 2. Merge to master | `git checkout master && git merge develop && git push origin master` | master becomes 1.8.0 |
| 3. Bump develop to next minor | Back on `develop`, bump `manifest.json` version, commit, push | develop becomes 1.9.0 |

**Rules:**
- `develop` version is ALWAYS one minor version ahead of `master` — no exceptions
- After every merge to master, immediately bump develop and push
- Hotfixes on master use patch bumps (e.g., 1.8.1) — develop stays where it is
- Version in `manifest.json` must be pure numeric `major.minor.patch` — Firefox rejects suffixes like `-dev`
- The version number doubles as a dev/release indicator: if the extension shows 1.9.0 in `about:debugging`, you're running develop

## AMO (Firefox Add-ons) Distribution

Extension is submitted to addons.mozilla.org from `master` branch.

- **`data_collection_permissions`** in `manifest.json` — required by AMO. Declares `websiteContent` and `browsingActivity` as required (page content and URLs flow to Anthropic's API)
- **Third-party libraries** must have source attribution in `sidebar/lib/README.md` — AMO requires this for any minified code
- **`unsafe-eval`** — justified as AI-powered devtools console. `execute_script` is gated behind user confirmation modal. No remote code loading. Reviewer notes explain both eval paths (`eval()` in content script, `new Function()` in tool-router)
- **AMO zip** is built from `master` with exclusions: `.git/`, `.idea/`, `HANDOFF.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `.DS_Store`

## Conventions

- No build step — raw JS/CSS/HTML loaded directly by Firefox
- State stored in `browser.storage.local`
- Sidebar conversation state persisted across close/reopen as `foxhole_sidebar_state` in `browser.storage.local` (24h TTL, base64 images and image content blocks stripped to manage size)
- CSS uses custom properties defined in `:root` in `sidebar.css`
- No generic `.hidden` utility class — use scoped `.modal.hidden` or `style.display`
- Token display has visual tiers at 50k/100k/150k cumulative tokens
- Welcome screen defined in both `sidebar.html` (initial load) and `tab-manager.js:getWelcomeMessageHtml()` (tab switch) — keep in sync
- Any tool returning `result.screenshot` (a data URL) gets converted to a Claude vision image block in `background.js` — universal image pipeline
- Screenshots stored in `docs/screenshots/`, named with numeric prefix for sort order
- Spec content is backtick-escaped (`\u200B`) at save time to prevent code fence breakout in prompt formatting
- Visual Selection tracks selected elements in a JS `Set` (source of truth) + `MutationObserver` to re-apply `data-user-selected` when SPAs (React/Vue) wipe DOM attributes on re-render
- `STREAM_DELTA` messages are excluded from the sidebar console log (fires per streaming token — too noisy); all other message types still log
- "Your turn" nudge — `chatContainer` gets class `awaiting-reply` when Claude's final response ends with `?`; CSS `::after` shows a pulsing "↩ your turn" indicator; class removed on first keystroke
- Model migration runs in `sidebar.js:loadSettings()` — old model IDs without date suffixes (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5`) are silently remapped to canonical IDs and persisted
- Debug logs use per-context storage keys: `foxholeDebugLogs_bg`, `foxholeDebugLogs_sidebar`, `foxholeDebugLogs_content` — options page merges and sorts all three by timestamp
- Stop button cancels using `streamingTabId` (the tab that started the stream), not the currently active tab — these differ when the user switches tabs mid-stream

## CRITICAL: browser-polyfill.min.js

**NEVER add `browser-polyfill.min.js` to `sidebar/sidebar.html`.** Firefox has native `browser.*` support, but the polyfill's UMD wrapper unconditionally overwrites `globalThis.browser` with `{}` even on Firefox — every `browser.*` call then throws and no buttons work.

The polyfill is only loaded in:
- `background/service-worker.js` via `importScripts` (Chrome only)
- Content scripts via `manifest.chrome.json` injection (Chrome only)

For the Chrome port, the sidebar uses a conditional init script (`sidebar-init.js`) that detects `typeof browser === 'undefined'` before loading the polyfill.

## Chrome Port

Instructions for porting to Chrome MV3 live at:
`/Users/makram/dev/chrome-extensions/foxhole-for-claude/CLAUDE.md`

Key points: no code changes needed to shared files; Chrome port uses `manifest.chrome.json` + `background/service-worker.js` + a build script that copies the repo and swaps the manifest. The sidebar polyfill conditional-load pattern is the main Chrome-specific addition needed in sidebar HTML.

## Testing

No automated tests. Manual testing in Firefox via `about:debugging` > Load Temporary Add-on.
